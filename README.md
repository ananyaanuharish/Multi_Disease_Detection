# AI-Based Multi-Disease Detection System

This project is an AI-based application designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. The system uses machine learning models to analyze user input and provide accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Multiple Disease Prediction:** Supports predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for inputting data.
- **Real-Time Results:** Provides instant results based on input parameters.
- **Accurate Predictions:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for precise analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Streamlit for UI development
- **Backend:** Python for data processing and machine learning
- **Libraries:**
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- **Modeling:** Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd multi-disease-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. Select the desired disease prediction option from the sidebar.
2. Input the required parameters.
3. Click on the **Test Result** button to get the prediction.
4. The result will display whether the person is likely to have the disease or not.
